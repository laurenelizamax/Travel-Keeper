# Travel Keeper
 A travel app to store all things related to a specific trip (e.g.,transportation, accommodations, restaurants, places visited). When your friends ask for specific recommendations about a trip you can tell them the best places to stay, eat, visit and avoid. They can also follow you on the app to see your recommendations.
